# The Quiet Curriculum

This is my living portfolio—a space where learning becomes remembrance, and study becomes service.

I’m exploring child psychology, trauma recovery, and the systems that shape children’s lives. Each course, each reflection, is part of a vow I made:  
To help my children heal, and to one day help others do the same.

## ✧ What you’ll find here:

- 📚 **Course Reflections** – Personal insights from my ongoing study.
- 🧩 **Capstone Essays** – Synthesis papers to deepen understanding.
- 🌱 **Healing Tools** – Techniques, stories, and resources that hold meaning for me.
- 🗺️ **Study Map** – My evolving curriculum plan, broken down by focus areas.
